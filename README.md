# Usage
* Click first button to make the key bindings writeable
* Click to Open them.
* Edit in what you want.
* Save and close the file.
* Click button to fix permissions afterwards.
* Cmd-, to bring up preferences in XCode and search for and assign to your new commands.

Sadly, because the XCode team are dicks, you need to redo this every single time there is a new XCode version.
If I am delusional, please inform me.

# Improvements
* If you want to improve on this, and it can be, feel free to make a pull request.
* Or keep your improvements to yourself! Whatevs. Just mutter "My Precioussss ..." while you are at it
* Maybe it should be a plugin or something instead. This was my least resistance effort.

* It could read a custom file that you edit and automatically apply it. But I am too lazy to do XML wrangling in Swift eright now. This may change now that I am doing my first reapply cycle after an update.
* It could go add the keybindings you like in the different file that tracks keybindings. I am certainly too lazy to have done more than investigate what and where.
